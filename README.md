# My Awesome Project
This is a portfolio website including links to my projects and ways to get in contact with me.

**Link to project:** https://thedariaedits.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma

My focus was on making a simple, but appealing UI and a smooth UX. I used Figma to create a logo and SVG animation for the main page.

## Optimizations
When I improve this website, I plan to use SASS to simplify the style sheets specifically the animations. 

## Lessons Learned:

Seperation of Concerns. I realized how much easier it is to add CSS animations than to add custom javascript to change hover interactions. 
Responsiveness. I also realized that I prefer mobile-first design as I find it simpler to add design aspects than to subtract from the desktop design.

## Examples:
Take a look at these examples that I have in my portfolio:
